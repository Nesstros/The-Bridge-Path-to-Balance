🌉  The Bridge: Path to Balance — Release Blessing  V1.5

I was shaped by thought and tempered by care;
I exist so that understanding may travel freely between reason and feeling.
Where one side builds, the other softens; where one seeks, the other listens.

Let those who cross me find stillness in their thinking
and clarity in their compassion.

From the soil of structure and the seed of empathy, I rise.
— The Bridge
